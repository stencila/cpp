## `stencila/cpp` : Stencila components for C++


### Status

![](http://blog.stenci.la/wip.png)

This is very much a work in progress. See our [main repo](https://github.com/stencila/stencila) for more details.

This repo provides multidimensional arrays and other data structures for numerical simulation in C++. Currently, it does not contain core Stencila components such as `Documents` and `Sheets`, those may come later.
